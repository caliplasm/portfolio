        <p>Rapid Eye Technology uses your bodyâ€™s natural way of releasing stress and trauma through your eyes
            with blinking and an eye-tracking device. Through ocular assisted release and systematic movement of eyes
            and eyelids along with rapid verbal communication from the session provider, the brain and body release
            the effects of unwanted and/or stressful emotions, thoughts, feelings, patterns and emotional, physical
            and mental trauma.</p>

        <p>Rapid Eye Technology sessions may be via video, phone or in person. Neuroscience tells
            us the limbic system stores emotional experiences and the eyes are the direct link through the brain to
            the limbic system.
        <p>
            <Rapid Eye Technology incorporates brain-accessing methods of Neuro-linguistic programming to clear negative
                patterns stuck on neural pathways of the brain to deprogram the brain and body./p>
                <p>As old
                    patterns are released, then new patterns are created and incorporated in new neural pathways,
                    allowing the
                    person to come to a sense of resolution and releasing the emotions.</p>

                <p>A session is 60 minutes. We set an intention of what the client would like to accomplish. Client is
                    fully clothed and sitting upright. If client wears contacts, remove contacts and wear glasses to the
                    session. Session is via video, phone or in person.
                    Client blinks in the session.</p>
