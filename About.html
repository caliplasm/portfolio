                    Sound
                    Healer and Yoga Therapist, Cate is on a mission to empower the planet to appreciate and
                    create the
                    life they desire.</p>
                <p>In childhood, I was introduced to alternative medicine and healing as my father underwent
                    three
                    surgeries,
                    which caused him worse pain than his initial car accident. My mother, trained as an RN,
                    learned
                    and
                    taught
                    me about acupuncture, kinesiology, muscle testing, visual training, homeopathy, acupressure,
                    Shamanic
                    healing and so many other modalities.</p>

                <p>At 18, I began to study and certify in many modalities. Having trained in Brain gym, Reiki,
                    EFT-Tapping,
                    Crucial Conversations, Crucial Confrontations, Journey work, Neurolinguistic Programming,
                    hypnotherapy,
                    Emotion Code, Body Code, Chakras, Morter March, Divine Intervention, Angel work, Meditation,
                    Shamanism,
                    Drumming,
                    Advanced Sound healing, Biofield Tuning, Yoga therapy, Marconics, Resonance repatterning,
                    Reflexology,
                    Advanced Cranial Sacral, Rapid Eye Technology, Foot zoning, Access Consciousness and many
                    others, I
                    incorporate these
                    tools in my work with my clients.</p>

                <p>Having experienced over 600 modalities, I have chosen to train extensively in the ones I’ve
                    found
                    to
                    be
                    the
                    most effective and the best of the best. I continue to train and learn and incorporate new
                    learnings
                    with
                    my clients.</p>

                <p>I enjoy working with clients who desire change and are willing to move forward to create the
                    life
                    they
                    desire. I assist my clients release stress and trauma from the brain and body so they can
                    create
                    the
                    lives
                    they want to live.</p>

                <p>If you desire better--if you believe you can and are willing to do the work--you can.</p>

                <p>I’d love to work with you and facilitate you in your healing journey. I love watching my
                    clients
                    transform and receive all they desire.</p>
