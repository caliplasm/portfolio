                    <p>Rapid Eye Technology uses your body’s natural way of releasing stress and trauma through your
                        eyes with
                        blinking and an eye-tracking device. Through ocular assisted release and systematic movement of
                        eyes and
                        eyelids along with rapid verbal communication from the session provider, the brain and body
                        release the
                        effects of unwanted and/or stressful emotions, thoughts, feelings, patterns and emotional,
                        physical and
                        mental trauma.</p>
                    <p>Rapid Eye Technology sessions may be via video, phone or in person. Neuroscience tells us
                        the limbic system stores emotional experiences and the eyes are the direct link through the
                        brain to the
                        limbic system. Rapid Eye Technology incorporates brain-accessing methods of Neuro-linguistic
                        programming
                        to clear negative patterns stuck on neural pathways of the brain to deprogram the brain and
                        body. As old
                        patterns are released, then new patterns are created and incorporated in new neural pathways,
                        allowing
                        the person to come to a sense of resolution and releasing the emotions.</p>
                    <p>A session is 60 minutes. We set an intention of what the client would like to accomplish. Client
                        is

                        the

                        <p>Divine Intervention (DI) is an ancient Mayan Shamanic Healing Technique passed
                            down through the Curanderos lineage of master healers. Using energy throughout
                            the physical and etheric bodies of dimensions and frequencies by calling in
                            source to intervene on behalf of the healee to direct electrical, light, sacred
                            geometry and magnetic energy. DI removes disharmonious energies from the system.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through the transformation of the energy field, blockages, pathogenic energies,
                            non-vital body components and energy distortions are removed from the body as
                            they are unable to keep up with the constant changes in the energy field at the
                            high frequency and speed. The disease producing information flow and the
                            non-vital parts (tissue/cell) may leave the client’s system as the
                            electromagnetic waves separate into electric and magnetic waves which allows the
                            body to go into a predisposition for healing.</p>
                        <p>Results depend on the healee and may be seen in both the physical manifestation
                            of the body and the spontaneous remission observed while the healee experiences
                            harmony and balance to see the core issue of the illness and resolve dis-ease
                            original cause or manifestation. Sessions are effective for severe and chronic
