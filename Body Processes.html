        <p>Access BarsÂ® are 32 points on your head. When these points are touched, they hold all of the energy and the
            brain easily releases any thoughts, feelings, ideas, beliefs, considerations and emotions that keep you
            limited and prevent you from feeling ease and joy. Access Bars are energetic bars that run through and
            around your head.</p>

        <p class="thick">Access Energetic Facelift</p>
        <p>Access Energetic FaceliftTM is a hands-on or hands-off body process, which can rejuvenate the face and
            reverse the signs of aging on the face and throughout the entire body. When these points are touched on the
            face, neck, chest and body, the body may transform and release limiting energies and judgments and cells may
            restore, enliven and rejuvenate. Recommendation is 15-20 sessions.</p>
