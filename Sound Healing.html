        <img src="/images/Sound-healing-bowl.jpg" alt="Sound Healing" width="250" height="250">
        <p>Healing through sound uses the tones and frequencies of tuning forks, drumming, crystal bowls
            Tibetan bowls, chimes, shakers and the voice to align the body and body parts to its original,
            harmonious blueprint.</p>
        <p>Sound healing is used for both personal development and relaxation.
            Using biofield tuning techniques as well as sound healing techniques to remove any blocks of frequency
            and vibration within the body, sound healing may reduce stress, anxiety, improve sleep and create a
            deeper sense of wellbeing.</p>
