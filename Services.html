                    <p>Rapid Eye Technology uses your body’s natural way of releasing stress and trauma through your
                        eyes with
                        blinking and an eye-tracking device. Through ocular assisted release and systematic movement of
                        eyes and
                        eyelids along with rapid verbal communication from the session provider, the brain and body
                        release the
                        effects of unwanted and/or stressful emotions, thoughts, feelings, patterns and emotional,
                        physical and
                        mental trauma.</p>
                    <p>Rapid Eye Technology sessions may be via video, phone or in person. Neuroscience tells us
                        the limbic system stores emotional experiences and the eyes are the direct link through the
                        brain to the
                        limbic system. Rapid Eye Technology incorporates brain-accessing methods of Neuro-linguistic
                        programming
                        to clear negative patterns stuck on neural pathways of the brain to deprogram the brain and
                        body. As old
                        patterns are released, then new patterns are created and incorporated in new neural pathways,
                        allowing
                        the person to come to a sense of resolution and releasing the emotions.</p>

                            the
