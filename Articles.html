                        <p>Since the world-wide pandemic, many people's lives have been hijacked with fear. Are you
                            fearful? Are you
                            tired?
                            Are you wanting something just a little bit better?</p>

                        <p> Do you desire to see more opportunities in your life? Do you desire to see more
                            possibilities in life?
                        </p>

                        <p>Would you like to access more super powers from your brain?
                        <p>

                        <p>About 95% of the earth's population of people, their brains are wired left brain to right eye
                            and right
                            brain to
                            left eye, which is referred to as cross processors. However, 5% of the population is wired
                            with parallel
                            brains
                            meaning left brain is wired to left eye and right brain is wired to right eye, which is
                            referred to as
                            parallel
                            processors.</p>

                        <p>Generally, the left brain is analytical, detailed, assigns labels, relying on past experience
                            and logic.
                            The
                            right brain is creative, sees the big picture, solutions, gathers and collects information,
                            sees
                            similarities
                            and focuses on the future of possibilities. Every part of the brain serves a function.</p>

                        <p>It's not unusual for someone to get stuck on a neural pathway and go down the rabbit hole of
                            what the
                            person
                            most commonly practices such as worry. However, you can interrupt that pattern and create a
                            new neural
                            pathway.
                        </p>

                        <p>Ideally, when someone is whole brained--using both their right and left side of their brain
                            hemispheres,
                            then
                            one may see different possibilities. To leverage your brain's super powers, do the
                            following:</p>

                        <p>Drive to CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid and buy an eye patch now. Use an eye patch daily 15 minutes
                            on each eye,
                            while
                            watching TV, on the computer or phone or reading a book. NEVER use an eye patch while
                            driving, operating
                            machinery or while cooking, cutting or cleaning. Please use your best judgment.</p>

                        <p>An eye patch is a tool to exercise your brain--to exercise the muscles in your brain. Many
                            people
                            exercise the
                            muscles in their body and few even think to exercise their brain. Every person on this
                            planet can
                            benefit from
                            daily use of an eye patch.</p>

                        <p>By completely covering one eye so there is no light that comes in, while the person is awake,
                            the input
                            is only
                            coming in one eye. As a result, the brain can literally see different possibilities and
                            opportunities.
                        </p>

                        <p>When you're in a situation, and find yourself going down the rabbit hole of worry, put an eye
                            patch on.
                            The eye
                            patch interrupts the pattern of worry, and your brain is given another job to do so you can
                            see
                            different
                            possibilities.</p>

                        <p>Overall, eye patching facilitates the right and left brain communication. </p>

                    <div class="item"><br />
                        <p>When most people feel stuck, it's because they are literally, they are stuck on a neural
                            pathway in
                            their
                            brain, and they cannot get off the neural pathway or shift to a different neural
                            pathway. <span id="dots">...</span></p><span id="more"></p>

                            <p>So when they are stuck on a neural pathway, that means that their cognitive
                                processes, which are
                                the
                                mental processes of knowing, including awareness, perception, reasoning and judgment
                                are also
                                stuck,
                                and that they cannot see, hear, feel, taste, touch or sense a different way of doing
                                anything or
                                being.</p>

                            <p>Would you like to get unstuck? Would you like to move forward in life?</p>
                            <p>Directed eye movement positively affects a person's cognitive processes. Cognitive
                                processes
                                determine a person's performance in mental or cognitive activities, which include
                                processing
                                information received from the 6 senses which allow thought, perception, storage of
                                information
                                and
                                interpretation of the external world.</p>
                            <p>12 Basic cognitive processes exist in human beings and are used with learning
                                including (1)
                                perception coupled with hearing, seeing, touching, tasting, smelling, tasting,
                                sensing, (2)

                            <p>A pair of Beckman Institute researchers discovered by directing the eye movements of
                                test
                                subjects
                                they were able to affect the participants’ ability to solve a problem, demonstrating
                                that eye
                                movement is not just a function of cognition but can actually affect our cognitive
                                processes.

                            <p>Eye movement affects our cognitive processes, and eye movement can shift us off of
                                one neural
                                pathway and go to another neural pathway.</p>
